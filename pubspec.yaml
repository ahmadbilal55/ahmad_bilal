  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
     - assets/icons/
     - assets/images/
     - assets/animations/

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
   - family: Caviar_Dreams
     fonts:
       - asset: fonts/CaviarDreams.ttf
       - asset: fonts/Caviar_Dreams_Bold.ttf
         weight: 700
       - asset: fonts/CaviarDreams_Italic.ttf
         style: italic
       - asset: fonts/CaviarDreams_BoldItalic.ttf
         weight: 700
         style: italic
