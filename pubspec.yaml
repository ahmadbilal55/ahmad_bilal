  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - images/background_image.png
    - assets/icons/
    - assets/images/
    - assets/animations/
    - assets/projects/shades/
    - assets/projects/angels/
    - assets/projects/fufa/
    - assets/projects/secret_days/

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
   - family: quicksand
     fonts:
       - asset: assets/fonts/quicksand/Quicksand-Light.ttf
         weight: 300
       - asset: assets/fonts/quicksand/Quicksand-Regular.ttf
         weight: 400
       - asset: assets/fonts/quicksand/Quicksand-Medium.ttf
         weight: 500
       - asset: assets/fonts/quicksand/Quicksand-SemiBold.ttf
         weight: 600
       - asset: assets/fonts/quicksand/Quicksand-Bold.ttf
         weight: 700
